# Heart Disease Prediction Model
## Project Overview<br>
According to the 2024 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Report from the American Heart Association, heart disease has been the leading cause of death in the U.S. for 100 years. It presents a formidable global health challenge, with its multifaceted nature demanding complex strategies for prevention and early detection. Despite significant medical advancements, heart disease remains prevalent due to risk factors like diabetes, obesity, smoking, and sedentary lifestyles.<br>

## Project Goal<br>
The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that predicts heart disease with at least 85% recall using data from the CDC. High recall is crucial for minimizing false negatives, ensuring that individuals with heart disease are correctly identified for timely treatment and intervention. Data-driven insights from this model will help healthcare systems and insurance companies optimize resource allocation and develop accurate risk assessment models.<br>
